                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">When does NutriTrainer use end user information from third parties?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">NutriTrainer will collect End User Data necessary to provide the NutriTrainer services to our customers.
                   End users may voluntarily provide us with information they have made available on social media websites. If you provide us with any such information, we may collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">When does NutriTrainer use customer information from third parties?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming a NutriTrainer customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to NutriTrainer. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the app, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the app. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the app in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the app. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the app and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p>

                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
                     <ul class="text-muted">
                       <li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li>
                       <li>To improve our app (we continually strive to improve our app offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
                       <li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)</li>
                       <li>To process transactions</li>
                       <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature</li>

                     </ul>
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">By submitting your email address on this app, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide NutriTrainer to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to NutriTrainer or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">NutriTrainer is incorporated in Brazil. Information collected via our app, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Is the information collected through the NutriTrainer Service secure?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Can I update or correct my information?</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information NutriTrainer collects depend on your relationship with NutriTrainer. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>
                   <br>
                                      <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Sale of Business</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of NutriTrainer or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of NutriTrainer or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Affiliates</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with NutriTrainer, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Governing Law</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Brazil without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">The laws of Brazil, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the app. Your use of the app may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
                   <p class="text-muted">By using NutriTrainer or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our app, or use our services. Continued use of the app, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h1 style="color: #474c52 !important;" class="text-muted">Your Consent</h1>
                   <p class="text-muted">We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit our site and how it's being used.
